# The python dependencies are pre-installed in the fusion-builder docker image,
# for repeatability, test time reduction, and convenience.
# Please keep the modules in this file alphabetically sorted for ease of use.
# If you add modules to this file, you will need to also update the docker image:
# - copy it to the jdk subdirectories in https://github.com/lucidworks/fusion-builder
# - push to github, which will trigger automated builds on https://hub.docker.com/r/lucidworks/fusion-builder/
# - wait for those images to rebuild (see the Build Details tab)
# - Update the images on the docker hosts:
# for host in build1 n1 n2 n3 n4; do
#   for build in openjdk-7 openjdk-8 oracle-jdk-7; do
#     ssh $host docker pull lucidworks/fusion-builder:$build
#   done
#   ssh $host docker pull lucidworks/fusion-builder
# done
# If your library requires special Ubuntu libraries, you'll need to add them
# to the Dockerfile in the jdk subdirectories.
# If in doubt, ask mak in #apollo-build. Kiran and drewpink can also help out.
